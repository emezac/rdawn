üöÄ Calling OpenAI API...
Model: gpt-4o-mini
----------------------------------------
‚úÖ Success!

ü§ñ AI Response:
As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have access to real-time news updates. However, I can summarize some of the key developments regarding Donald Trump up to that point:

1. **Legal Challenges**: Trump has faced multiple legal challenges, including criminal charges related to his business practices, election interference, and classified documents. These cases have been ongoing, with various court dates and hearings scheduled.

2. **2024 Presidential Campaign**: Trump has been actively campaigning for the 2024 presidential election, maintaining a strong presence in Republican primaries. He has been holding rallies and making public appearances to solidify his support among GOP voters.

3. **Public Statements and Controversies**: Trump has continued to make headlines with his statements on social media and in public speeches, often addressing his legal issues, criticizing opponents, and discussing his vision for the country.

4. **Polls and Support**: Despite his legal troubles, Trump has remained a leading figure in Republican polls, often showing strong support among party members.

For the most current updates, I recommend checking reliable news sources.
